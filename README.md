Using Tetris as a basis to implement reinforcement learning algorithm.  

Acknowledgement:
The implementation of Tetris was based  on a YouTube video

The code in this project is a modified version of the code in the video.  The most obvious differencenis that this version has a random rotation of the 4-block piece.
