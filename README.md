# ReinforcementLearning_w_Tetris
Using Tetris as a basis to implement reinforcement learning algorithm.  

This project begins with devling into Machine Learning.  More specifically, Reinforcement Learning.  Rather than add lengthy definitions, Here are links to explore these topics:

The implementation of Tetris was based  on a YouTube video

The code in this project is a modified version of the code in the video.  The most obvious difference is that this version has a random rotation of the 4-block pattern.  

Tetris was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.  A five-cube game, Pentamino, was the basis for the game.  Two modifications can before the success of te faniliar result.  The number of pieces in each shape was reduced from five to four.  Next, the pieces were made to descend into a rectrangular glass.  Tetris was born.  The name of the game "Tetris" Pajitnov combined from 2 words: the name of the original game—"tetramino" and his favorite sport—"tennis".
